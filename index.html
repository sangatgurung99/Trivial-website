    <h1>BIM321 Project</h1>
    <h2>Part A – Create Basic Website</h2>
    
    <p>Each student will create a website with several web pages that use
            HTML5, CSS3 and images. Students are expected to implement fully functional navigation between the pages.</p>
    
     
   <p>You will need to create a website to show case your abilities – an online portfolio of your work.
        The website should consist of several pages with properly implemented navigation between them. At a minimum,
        your website should consist of at least three web pages. You are encouraged to have more pages if doing so provides a better user experience.</p> 
     
   <p>When designing and implementing the website, you need to keep the following requirements in mind:</p>
         
     <ul> 
           <li>Showcase your existing work and, if appropriate, provide narrative for it. Highlight
            your talents and abilities.</li>
            
            <li>Project a  professional image. Your audience is prospective employers, clients or recruitment agents</li>
           
            <li>Provide a method for    interested parties to contact you.</li>
           
            <li> Your website should work well on a desktop computer with Firefox and Chrome.</li>
     </ul>
