    <h2>Brief subject description</h2>
    
    <p>Online presence is a part of every day life. Web content needs to be delivered to various devices and needs to be
    available and accessible at all times. There are many technologies involved and these change rapidly. This subject
    will introduce students to the core technologies involved in delivering web content. Students will have an
    opportunity to build a simple web site and learn about techniques and strategies for maintaining web presence. The
    subject will also teach students how to evaluate and select web technologies and how to stay up to date with
    relevant trends and standards. The main focus will be on front-end, but students will be introduced to all
    components of the full-stack. Practical components will focus on the most widely deployed technologies to equip
    students with skills that are immediately applicable in the real-world and in demand by employers.</p>
